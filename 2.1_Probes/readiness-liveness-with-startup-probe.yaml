        # Readiness probes help Kubernetes know when to start sending traffic to the pod.
        #   This probe helps kubernetes to "add" or "remove" this pod from the service in front of it.
        #   So, when the probe passes it is added to the service,
        #       when it fails at any time in it's life, kubernetes removes it from the service.
        # Restarting the "stuck" container is the job of livenessProbe, explained further down.
        # Note: Readiness probe runs throughout the life of the container - every "periodSeconds",
        #       not just at the container start time!
        #
        # The WITPASS/wordpress images takes long to start, 
        #   because themes and plugins are pulled at container start time.

          #   before kubernetes gives up and marks the "pod" as "Unready":
          failureThreshold: 24

          # In the case above, the Pod will be marked "Unready",

        # Liveliness probes are used while the container is up, 
        #   to see if the service is "still" alive.
        # If the service does not respond, then kubernetes kills the container/pod,
        #   and restarts it.
        # It is therefore important to have initialDelaySeconds for the "livenessProbe"
        #   to be as late as possible.
        # If it is a small number, and if for some reason container is not started yet,
        #   (in case of slow application startup), then kubernetes will restart it.
        # This means the pod will stuck in a crash loop, and will never start.
        # Remember, livenessProbe does NOT start AFTER readiness probe.
        #   In-fact, they both start at the same time.
        # Liveness probe will vary from application to application. 
        #   Some start fast, some start slow.
