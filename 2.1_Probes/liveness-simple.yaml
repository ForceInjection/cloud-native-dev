        # Liveliness probes are used while the container is up, 
        #   to see if the service is "still" alive.
        # If the service does not respond, then kubernetes kills the container/pod,
        #   and restarts it.
        # It is therefore important to have initialDelaySeconds for the "livenessProbe"
        #   to be as late as possible.
        # If it is a small number, and if for some reason container is not started yet,
        #   (in case of slow application startup), then kubernetes will restart it.
        # This means the pod will stuck in a crash loop, and will never start.
        # Remember, livenessProbe does NOT start AFTER readiness probe.
        #   In-fact, they both start at the same time.
        # Liveness probe will vary from application to application.
